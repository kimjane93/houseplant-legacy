# houseplant-legacy

## Getting Started
* Welcome to [Houseplant Legacy](https://houseplant-legacy.herokuapp.com/)! Where the goal is to create your ideal collection of houseplants, whether by popping into the plantshop to pick up a reccomendation from the shop owner, or by checking the roster of plants currently in rotation, and seeing which, if any, of the other users may have that particular plant you can take a clipping of! 
* People can be protective of their houseplants, so some may choose to share some of their plants, while they hoard others. 
  * If you don't have any luck finding the plant you're looking for, or users have them but aren't allowing clippings at the time, you can head over to the message board to ask a kind soul to share their collection with you! Have fun, the plants in rotation are always growing, so there will always be new houseplants to covet!
